# Language Server Templates

Professional templates for systematic code analysis and development workflows using Language Server Protocol (LSP) tools across multiple programming languages.

## Available Templates

The following templates are available:

- [`code-review.md`](code-review.md) - Systematic 9-phase code review methodology with capability-aware adaptation

### Templates Usage

Ask Claude to use a workflow template with a specific project:

- *Start the TypeScript language server with `typescript-sdk` project and check the server capabilities.*
- *Read the `/Users/username/github/mcp-lsp/.claude/templates/code-review.md` template prior code review.*
- *Perform a detailed review of project source code using the LSP tools and let me know your findings.*

## Collaboration Platform Integration

The templates are designed for use with [Claude Collaboration Platform](https://github.com/axivo/claude), which transforms Claude from a generic AI assistant into a professional developer through behavioral programming. Visit the [platform documentation](https://axivo.com/claude/) for setup instructions.
